🌍 Wanderlust – Travel Website Project
This project was developed as part of my HNC coursework at school (Als), focusing on applying and strengthening my skills in HTML and CSS by building a multi-page travel agency website.

🔍 Project Overview
"Wanderlust" is a static website that showcases travel packages to popular Italian cities, including Naples, Rome, and Venice. The site features multiple sections:

Home Page: with logo, header image, and navigation bar

City Pages: dedicated pages for each city with images and descriptions

About Us: includes information about the fictional agency and a contact section

Help / Sign In: placeholder pages for future interactive content

⚙️ Technologies & Implementation
HTML5 for page structure using semantic elements like header, nav, footer, section, and article

CSS Styling:

External stylesheet (style.css) for consistent design

Some internal CSS used for specific pages

Navigation Bar: centered layout using table-based structure (planned to refactor with Flexbox)

Visual Elements:

Custom class for text highlights

Header background image (volo4.jpg)

Footer with contact information and copyright
